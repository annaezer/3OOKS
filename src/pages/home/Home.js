                    <p>We donâ€™t care about money; we just care about having less stress. Therefore, 3OOKS is a free
                        application that helps you choose the books you want to read. No more endless scrolling through
                        websites, databases, or lists - just 3 ways to search and get 3 books to choose from. Easy! This
                        leaves more time to actually read the book! Of course, we don't help you tackle the big problems
                        in life here, but making decisions easier can help reduce stress in your day-to-day life,
                        right?</p>
                    <p>You can search in a <Link to="/database">Database</Link> by author, title or subject. More fun
                        is the <Link to="/questions">Questions</Link> option, where you can get books based on your
                        mood, available time and need for reviews. If you prefer it as easy as possible, click on
                        the <Link to="/bestsellers">Bestsellers</Link> and choose one from the top 3 to start reading!
                        You don't have to sign up to use the app, but if you do you can save your favourite books, and
                        we may add some cool features in the future. All for free, so why not start there?</p>
